You can use the file explorer from your operating system to navigate the user friendly directory structure of a YAML configuration, and you can use any standard text editor to view and edit the individual YAML files.

Ideally, a standard IDE can be used to create a project and edit the files of a YAML configuration. The externalized files for scripts, JSON, and so on allow you to edit these files in an editor that is syntax-aware.

## Edit a YAML configuration with ES Explorer

[ES Explorer](/docs/apigtw_devguide/entity_store/#use-the-es-explorer) can be used with some limitations to view, navigate, and edit a YAML configuration. To connect to a YAML configuration, enter a URL of the form `yaml:file:/root/dir/of/yaml`.

## Create a new policy

Policy Studio is not supported for YAML configuration as yet, but making minor changes to an existing policy, or other configuration, using an IDE with YAML syntax checking should be straightforward. You must also use the `yamles` validate option to check the validity of the configuration.

Building a new complex policy without an existing YAML format example might be challenging. To simplify this level of development, you can use the ES Explorer tool or Policy Studio as follows:

1. Create the structure of the policy.
2. Export the policy to a configuration fragment.
3. Convert the XML configuration fragment to YAML using `yamles frag2yaml` command.
4. Import the YAML configuration fragment into your main YAML project using `yamles import` command.
5. Repeat the export, `frag2yaml`, and `import` steps as many times as required to import all the required configuration into your main YAML configuration.

We recommend you to develop a new complex policy in an XML project that contains all the configuration you previously converted to YAML, so that you can reference other existing configuration. You must ensure that all referenced entities that need to be resolvable can be resolved eventually.

## Add a new certificate and private key to a YAML configuration

This section covers the steps required to add a new certificate and private key to an existing YAML configuration.

Note that certificates and private keys that exist in the XML federated configuration, which then get converted to YAML format, will be formatted as required with no additional steps required. In some cases, you might only need to add a new certificate to the YAML configuration, in this case the steps for the private key can be ignored.

1. You must have a certificate in a `PEM` file and its related private key in separate `DER` file, for example, `Axway-cert.pem` and `Axway-key.der`. The private key should be unencrypted.

2. For testing purposes, you can generate an unencrypted private key and self-signed certificate PEM files using openssl as follows:

    ```
    > openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout Axway-key.pem -out Axway-cert.pem
    Generating a RSA private key
    ................+++++
    ...............................................................................+++++
    writing new private key to 'Axway-key.pem'
    -----
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
    -----
    Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:IE
    State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Dublin
    Locality Name (eg, city) []:
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Axway
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
    Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Axway
    Email Address []:axway@axway.com
    ```

3. Convert the `Axway-key.pem` to an `Axway-key.der`:

    ```
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in Axway-key.pem -out Axway-key.der -nocrypt
    ```

4. Copy the `Axway-cert.pem` and `Axway-key.der` files into the `/Environment Configuration/Certificate Store` directory in your YAML entity store.

5. Edit the `Axway-cert.pem` file, remove the header and footer lines and leave only the base64 content. This is to allow the file to be loaded by the YAML entity store. Remove the following lines from `/Environment Configuration/Certificate Store/Axway-cert.pem`:

    ```
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

    The remaining file content will look like this:

    ```

    ```

6. Create the `/Environment Configuration/Certificate Store/Axway.yaml` file in your YAML entity store:

    ```yaml
    ---
    type: Certificate
    fields:
      dname: Axway
      key#refbinary: Axway-key.der
      content#ref: Axway-cert.pem
    ```

7. Edit another entity that requires a certificate and private key, for example an `XML Signature filter` (see the `signingCert` field in the following example). It now points to the new certificate and private key via its YamlPK `/Environment Configuration/Certificate Store/Axway`.

    ```yaml
    ---
    type: FilterCircuit
    fields:
      name: cert
      start: ./XML Signature Generation
    children:
    - type: GenerateSignatureFilter
      fields:
        signingCertAttribute: ""
        keyWrapAlgorithm: http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-oaep-mgf1p
        symmetricKeyEncryptionCertAttribute: ""
        name: XML Signature Generation
        signingCert: /Environment Configuration/Certificate Store/Axway   # <-- certificate ref
        symmetricKeyAttribute: ""
        wsuIdElementSpecification:
        - /System/Element Specifiers/http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/,Body,1
        - /System/Element Specifiers/http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope,Body,1
        attachmentTransform: ""
      routing:
        success: ../XML Signature Verification
      logging:
        fatal: 'Error during message signing. Error: ${circuit.exception}'
        failure: Failed to sign message
        success: Signed message successfully
      children:
      - type: KeyInfoFormat
        fields:
          keyNameValue: CN
          publicKeyInfoMask: 15
          keyNameType: 2
          certAttachmentId: ""
    ```

If the YAML configuration you are adding the certificate and private key into is encrypted with a passphrase, you will need to encrypt the private key file. To encrypt the private key file `Axway-key.der`, execute all the previous steps and complete the procedure with the following:

```shell
cd apigateway/posix/bin
./yamles encrypt --file ~/yaml/Environment\ Configuration/Certificate\ Store/Axway-key.der --passphrase changeme
The file `/home/user/yaml/Environment Configuration/Certificate Store/Axway-key.der` has been encrypted
```

After you complete on the YAML configuration, create a `.tar.gz` file and deploy it to your running API Gateway.

{{< alert title="Note">}}Encrypting a private key via `openssl` and adding it to the YAML configuration is not supported. You must do this before packaging the `.tar.gz` and deploying to a gateway group that has a matching passphrase.{{< /alert >}}

## Manually create an entity instance YAML file

{{< alert title="Note">}}
This section uses [Entity Types](/docs/apim_yamles/apim_yamles_references/yamles_types) directory.{{< /alert >}}

To create an entity instance of `NetService` type:

* Search for YAML file `NetService.yaml` within the `META-INF/types` directory.
* To know what fields can be used, move up to the ancestor types:
    * `NetService.yaml` is contained within `JavaProcess` directory. Check fields within YAML entity type file `JavaProcess.yaml`.
    * `JavaProcess.yaml` is contained within `Process` directory. Check fields within YAML entity type file `Process.yaml`.
    * Continue until reaching the root directory `Entity`.
* Search for components. Use the same approach you've used to search for fields).
* `NetService` has two components: `LoadableModule` and `ClassLoader`.
    * Search for `LoadableModule.yaml` and for `ClassLoader.yaml` YAML files within the `META-INF/types` directory.
    * Execute the first steps again to get all required and optional fields for each entity type.

If the entity instance you have created is a [container entity](/docs/apim_yamles/yamles_structure#_parentyaml), create a new directory named like the new entity instance. Create a YAML file named `_parent.yaml`, and put in within the created directory.

```yaml
---
type: NetService
fields:
  name: MyService
```

![new container entity](/Images/apim_yamles/yamles_new_container_entity.png)

If the entity instance you have created is not a container entity, create a YAML file named like the field *name*. Put it within the correct directory:

```yaml
---
type: InetInterface
fields:
  port: 8080
  name: My Traffic HTTP Interface
```

![new entity](/Images/apim_yamles/yamles_new_entity.png)

Despite what is in the model, some fields that are said to be mandatory (cardinality=1 and no default value) are not mandatory. Double check with Policy Studio when in doubt.
